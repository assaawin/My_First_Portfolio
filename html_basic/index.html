    <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>
    
    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <p>This is my first webpage created as part of the ALX project. I'm learning HTML and web development fundamentals.</p>
    
    <h3>Web Development Journey</h3>
    <p>Learning HTML is the first step in becoming a web developer. It's exciting to see how web pages are structured.</p>
    
    <p>Each element in HTML serves a specific purpose, from headings to paragraphs to images and links.</p>
    
    <p>Soon, I'll be adding CSS to make this page look even better and JavaScript to add interactivity.</p>
